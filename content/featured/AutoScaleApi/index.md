CampChamp is a website for adventurers who like to go camping. It's a platform form campers to share pictures and experience from their previous trips.

The project was my segue into web development and becoming a full stack software engineer. The website is minimalitic in design and uses pure HTML5 and CSS3 for styling. The project is deployed on the Heroku platform and github CI/CD.
