The [MENACE](https://www.mscroggs.co.uk/blog/19) project seeks to revive "The Menace," a learning machine for mastering Noughts and Crosses (Tic-Tac-Toe). Instead of physical matchboxes, it employs a hash table for efficient game state storage. Originating during a time of limited computing, this modern version utilizes readily available technology. It integrates Reinforcement Learning, rewarding correct moves to enhance decision-making. The machine simulates Noughts and Crosses gameplay, referencing its learned strategies and historical game states stored in the hash table. The primary objective is to create an AI system that independently learns and adapts its gameplay over time, with potential applications extending beyond games to robotics, autonomous systems, and decision-making processes.
