[MENACE](https://www.mscroggs.co.uk/blog/19) - (Machine Educable Noughts And Crosses Engine), a machine capable of learning to be a better player of Noughts and Crosses. As computers were less widely available at the time, MENACE was built from 304 matchboxes, The aim of this project is to implement “The Menace” by replacing matchboxes with values in a hash table having the key as the different states of the game.

Using the board state after each move as the key in a hash table, we choose the next move. The next move is determined by training the system using a Reinforcement learning algorithm, that incentivizes the algorithm every-time it makes a correct move.
