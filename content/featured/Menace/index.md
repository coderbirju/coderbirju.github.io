[MENACE](https://www.mscroggs.co.uk/blog/19)

- **Description:** The project aims to recreate "The Menace," a machine capable of learning and improving its Noughts and Crosses (Tic-Tac-Toe) gameplay over time. Instead of using physical matchboxes, it employs a hash table to store and retrieve game states.

- **Historical Context:** In the original Menace, computers were scarce, and the machine was constructed from 304 matchboxes. This modern version seeks to replicate its learning abilities using more readily available technology.

- **Hash Table Integration:** Replaces the physical matchboxes with a hash table where the unique board state after each move serves as the key. This allows for efficient storage and retrieval of game states.

- **Reinforcement Learning Algorithm:** Implements a Reinforcement Learning algorithm to train the system. The algorithm incentivizes the machine every time it makes a correct move, gradually improving its decision-making capabilities.

- **Game Logic:** The machine simulates Noughts and Crosses gameplay, making moves based on its learned strategies and historical game states stored in the hash table.

- **Objective:** The primary objective is to create an AI system that can autonomously learn and adapt its gameplay strategy over time, becoming a formidable Noughts and Crosses player.

- **Potential Applications:** While originally designed as a game-playing machine, this project's principles of reinforcement learning and hash table-based storage can have broader applications in AI, including robotics, autonomous systems, and decision-making processes.
