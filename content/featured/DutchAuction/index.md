- **Description:** Dutch Auction is a smart contract built on the Ethereum blockchain, facilitating the conducting of Dutch auctions for the sale of physical and digital assets.
- **Blockchain Technology:** The project leverages Ethereum, a leading blockchain platform known for its smart contract capabilities and decentralized nature.
- **Smart Contract Language:** Utilizes Solidity, a programming language designed for writing Ethereum smart contracts, to define the auction rules and asset transfers.
- **Development Environment:** Employs Hardhat, a development environment for Ethereum that streamlines smart contract development and testing.
- **Frontend Framework:** Built with React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, ensuring a user-friendly and interactive auction platform.
- **Wallet Integration:** Integrates MetaMask, a widely used Ethereum wallet browser extension, to enable users to participate in auctions securely.
- **Ethereum Network:** Operates on the Ethereum network, providing global accessibility and security for asset auctions.

This project combines blockchain technology, smart contracts, and a user-friendly frontend to create a platform where users can efficiently conduct Dutch auctions for their physical and digital assets on the Ethereum blockchain.
