Quizly is a user-friendly quiz and attendance app that was developed to simplify classroom management. Recognizing that professors often struggled with attendance and gauging student comprehension, we designed Quizly to address these challenges. With Quizly, instructors can effortlessly create quizzes, which students then complete. This not only marks attendance automatically but also provides valuable analytics and insights into class understanding. The technology stack behind Quizly includes JavaFX, Java, and MongoDB, all implemented following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. This combination ensures a seamless experience for both professors and students, making attendance tracking and concept comprehension assessment hassle-free in the modern classroom environment.
